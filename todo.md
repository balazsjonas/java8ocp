* invoking static interface method, the interface name must be included
* method with the same name does not override the method in subclass
  * eg. no restriction on return type, parameter types, and on exceptions
  * overloading???
* protected member is visible only in a specific way through inheritance
* inherited protected member becomes private to any other code outside the subclass
* in top-level classes abstract cannot be static?
* argument: The things between parentheses when invoking a method
* parameter: The things in the method's signature
* constructor cannot be overridden
* number ranges
* stack vs heap
* local variables must be initialized before use
* inner enum( optional semicolon, referencing)
* implementing class does not have to declare exceptions of the interface

* invoking static interface method, the interface name must be included
* method with the same name does not override the method in subclass
  * eg. no restriction on return type, parameter types, and on exceptions
  * overloading???
* protected member is visible only in a specific way through inheritance
* inherited protected member becomes private to any other code outside the subclass
